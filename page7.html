        The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified
        Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li
        wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
        historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China
        as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
        Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with
        selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
        first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on,
        many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
        border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming
        dynasty (1368–1644).
